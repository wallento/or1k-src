/* As an exception handler may also use the library, it is better to use
 * a different re-entrancy data structure for the exceptions.
 * This data structure is configured here and as part of the exception
 * handler (or1k_exception_handler) temporarily replaces the software's
 * impure data pointer.
 *
 * During initialization, the libraries standard _impure_data and the exception
 * impure data (_exception_impure_data) are initialized. Afterwards,
 * the current value _current_impure_ptr is set to _impure_ptr.
 *
 * At runtime __getreent is called to return the current reentrancy pointer,
 * which is stored in _current_impure_ptr.
 *
 * In the or1k_exception_handler the _current_impure_ptr is set to point to
 * _exception_impure_ptr. After the exception handler returned, it is set back
 * to _impure_ptr.
